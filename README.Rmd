# SimpleTextAnalysis
My project in Data science at the University of Oslo, Simple text analysis using R and Tidyverse 

# Introduction
In this project I used a data set of text and labels. I did some data wrangling and text mining. I also tried out some text analysis methods and multi-class classification of text data.

Disclaimer 1: This project has suffered from a wish to try a range of things, instead of doing one thing perfectly.
Disclaimer 2: I have found a lot of help with the coding in forums etc., some are copied, some are just the inspiration, and some are made by using the Tidyverseâ€™s cheat cheets.

# The data
Source:
I found the data through Kaggle, and then downloaded it from the original source:
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbamman/booksummaries.html

Description:
Plot summaries of 16,559 books extracted from the November 2, 2012 dump of English- language Wikipedia. Tab-separated; columns
